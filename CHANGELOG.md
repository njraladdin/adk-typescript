# Changelog

## [current_version]
* Fixed tool function parameter handling in all examples and documentation
* Updated README.md with correct FunctionTool usage pattern showing explicit function declarations
* Fixed examples (quickstart, default_agent, callbacks, fields_planner) to use correct tool function signatures with `params: Record<string, any>`

## [v1.0.4]
* Migrated to @google/genai: Ported the codebase to use the official @google/genai package for improved Google AI integration
* Added runAgent functionality: New capability to run agents directly by executing files, making the package more versatile when installed
* Improved Environment Configuration: Moved project constants to .env file for better configuration management
* Fixed automatic function declarations generation
* Improved logic for checking whether to use Google AI or Vertex AI
* Added bash script for quick build and package linking during development
* Fixed VERSION object shorthand syntax error
* Fixed ES module import issue in CLI tests on Node.js 18.x
* Fixed undefined errors in LlmRequest.ts for strict TypeScript compilation
* Fixed TypeScript isolatedModules errors for CI
* Comprehensive test suite fixes across multiple components (FunctionTool, LlmAgentFields, sessionService, cliTools, BaseAgent, connectionsClient, enterpriseWebSearchTool, AgentTool, applicationIntegrationToolset, googleLlm, cli, asyncToolCallbacks, basetool, cliCreate)
* Added automated testing with GitHub Actions: Continuous integration now runs automatically
* Configured CI to run only unit tests
* Updated GitHub Actions to run tests only for Node.js version 20.x
* Fixed slow startup time on CLI run command
* Removed spammy console logs for cleaner output
* Cleaned up README
* Added example agent to README for better onboarding

## [1.0.3] 
* Removed JSDoc-based function description extraction, since JSDoc is not available at runtime for functions in TypeScript (unlike Python).
* Fixed an issue in `FunctionTool` where parameters from the LLM were not passed correctly to the wrapped function
* Updated state documentation to match Python version, adding missing sections for `outputKey`, `CallbackContext`/`ToolContext` state management, and TypeScript examples
* Corrected session & memory docs code snippets 
* Fixed tools-related example code snippets for the documentation.
* Simplified the agent template generated by cliCreate: tool functions are now provided directly in the tools array, without wrapping with FunctionTool.
* Added read-only state access in `ReadonlyContext` using a Proxy to prevent modifications, similar to the Python version.
* Fix hasLongRunningToolIds being set to true even though we did not have any long running functions due to check checking if that proprety exists and not if it has entries
* Refactored `ToolContext` to eliminate its redundant `toolEventActions` field and directly reuse the shared `_eventActions` from `CallbackContext`, to fix state not being updated correctly

## [1.0.2] 
* Fixed issue with ts-node dependency by including it as a runtime dependency
* Fix Before & After agent callbacks not implemented correctly
* Added missing functionality for automatic state delta tracking in callbacks.

## [1.0.1]
* Simplified install and structure: no global `npm -g` needed; all agents share one node_modules folder.
* Replaced `adk-ts` CLI command with a simpler `adk`, now run with `npx adk`.
* Fixed all TypeScript callback examples and documentation.

## [1.0.0]
* Port matches version 1.0.0 of the original Python package Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)

## [0.5.0]
* Initial TypeScript port of Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)
